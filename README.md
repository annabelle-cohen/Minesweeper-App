# Minesweeper-App
Minesweeper game with twist and scores table

The traditional minesweeper app that we are all familiar with but with a little twist.

the twist is , as you can see in my code there is accelerometer sensor that lock the first position of the phone, 
then every time the user move the phone from the origin position the screen is lock and tiles that exposed cover again and if that's not enough, more mines are added!
